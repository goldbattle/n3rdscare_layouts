# N3rds.care NodeCG Layouts

Overlay that leverages the [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) framework.
Starter code is based on cshomo11's [b2aExtraLife](https://github.com/cshomo11/b2aExtraLife/) repository.
Almost everything besides the folder structure has been changed to simplify it.
Please pardon the unclean code as I do not normally work within Javascript/Node ecosystem.
